                                                            A Tampa man and his nonprofit orgranization is making a difference in the community by helping veterans readjust to civilian life. Mike Halley joined the Marine Corps in 1960, at the age of 17. He was stationed in various places during his eight years of service, including two tours in Vietnam during the war. A door gunner for a helicopter unit known as the "Raging Bulls". Readjusting to life away from the frontlines was difficult for Mike, who continues to suffer from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Mike spent nine years living in a 9x12' room, not knowing what was wrong with him. One day his sister threw a Doberman pinscher into the room and told him to figure out what to do with it. That was the day, Halley says, he began his recovery. Mike and his wife Pam started Halley's K9's for Veterans in October 2008. Since then, they have helped over 100 dogs and veterans "one team at a time." All of the dogs are rescued from abusive homes and given shelter in Mike's 15-kennel, locked down compound. While they specialize in Doberman pinschers, Halley's team has worked with a variety of working dog breeds including small dogs.-written by 10News <br /><br />After our TWO WEEKS training here in Tampa, Florida, our dogs will “tell” you when something is going wrong in your body, BEFORE it is critical. Sometimes they will tell or warn the spouse/close family (Pack), that in its self is a plus. Here are true testimonies and stories below.

Well the dog obeys the sit command, but there was no time limit in that command and things are getting a bit intense for the dog, so she jumps up on the handlers shoulders and looked him straight in the eyes! A co worker asked him IF he was OK, he started to answer yes,, that he was OK, but after about 3 words out of his mouth,, he changed his mind and they called the ambulance to take him to the hospital.  Now,, he is alive and back at work, but IF he had learned how to “READ” his own dog,, he would have got in the hospital faster, the dog knew he was going to have that heart attack, but she did not know how to bark in english.

Two days later she goes to see her PC Doc, Doc says”I see you have a Service Dog, how do you like him?” She answers,, I really like him, but, I have to go back to the trainer because the dog keeps licking my forehead all the time!!! NOT a lick on my hand or face, only my forehead,, so the Doc says, “just in case lets send you in for an MRI and see if there is anything to see.  Well a long story short,, I held the dog while she had the MRI, it came back POSITIVE, a cancer tumor right in the (HYPOTHELMA) or middle of her eyes up high on the forehead! It was the size of a pencil eraser, and some kind of pills killed it off, she is now cancer free thanks to a dog!

On the walk all went well but towards the end of the walk the dog jerked on the leash, HARD, and yes, hard enough to pull his arm out of the shoulder socket!!  Well they loaded the hubby in the car and off to the Critical Care walk-in local place,, they X-ray’d his arm/shoulder, and the panic started,, he had a BLOOD CLOT and it was ready to do some serious damage heading to his heart! They bandaged his arm close to his chest and called the ambulance to take him to the big city hospital, when they got him there, and checked him out,, they rushed him into surgery! When he came out and talked to his wife, his words were this, “You can thank that dog for pulling the arm out of joint,, if that had NOT happened, I believe the clot would have killed him.”

                                                            A little red Doberman Pinscher  met this Vietnam veteran, he has an expermental “Blood Pressure Monitoring” device planted into his chest much like a Pace Maker for heart attacks. Well as the family was sitting watching TV that evening which was the 7th week of owning the dog. The dog was lying down on the floor by his handler when all of a sudden the dog jumped up and into the handlers lap, now the dog is about 55 to 60 lbs,, a BIG LAP DOG!! Well she was told to get down and lie. She obeyed, but in a few minutes, she went back onto his lap with her tail going about 80 miles per hour!! He again told her to get down and behave, well the next time she jumped up, the wife said,, why don’t you check your blood pressure?  He did, he then grabbed his pills and popped one into his mouth,, with the dog standing and watching him,, in about 2 to 3 minutes, the DOG went over by the chair and lied down, handler and wife looked at each other in amazement, needless to say,, the dog got a special treat!  Now on week number 9, just the handler was sitting down, and as I understand he can feel when the blood pressure is going down,, just not when goes up, and he felt it going down. he almost got his pill but thought he would “TEST” the dog,, RIGHT!!! —->(my comment) He said that while the dog was just snoozing, all of a sudden she perked her head up, looked at her owner/handler, then looked around the room and back at the owner, she then got up and went into the kitchen where the wife was, and started barking, he could hear the racket she was making, in a minute the wife came into the living room and the dog was leading her,, and asked what is going on?? The Handler said “my BP is going down, and I just wanted to see if and what she would do, if anything”  as he got up and grabed his pill box and as he took a pill, they all 3 stood for about 3 minutes (felt like a LONG TIME) but the dog broke it and just strolled over next to the chair the handler sits in and stretched out and snooze time! Now, we don’t know for 100% sure that the dog was alerting the wife, but she the handler and I believe it to be,, we tease the handler that the reason the dog went to the BOSS is because she was the one that TOLD YOU to get your pills the first time.  What a team.

We placed him at first with a veteran but it did not work out, so Pam had to drive up into Georgia to pick Gunny up, he was not abused, so we started to get him into our “way of life” again. Well here comes this Lt Col, when she arrived she was very timid, and what looked to me like a loss of self ! Well Gunny picker her out, and the Col. asked me if there was any way the dog could get out of the compound? I said No, no way out, why do you ask? and she opened up to me that she has a problem of walking in her sleep!! Hummm I was NOT PREPARED to hear that, so without having a great answer, I said “I believe Gunny will not let you get hurt, trust him.” Well, night came and in the morning out comes the Col., WHEW,, what a smile,, I asked what’s up? something happen in the night? The answer on 2 counts was GREAT, she said “I had the best night sleep that I have had in YEARS!” I replied great, she bounced into my words and said, “In the middle of the night Gunny got up on the bed and started nudging my face until I woke up!! agan,, I said great, so we don’t have to worry any more,, right?  We decided to watch him close and see what happens. We did NOT have long to wait, I would bet it was a giant smile on Gunny’s face when he came out, I am sure he wanted to hear what the Col. was going to tell us from her happy mouth!! Sure enough, here she came, I was in the kennel she came into the kennel while Gunny took care of business, and with the biggest smile she told me that Gunny had crawled into the bed and lied across her body, (much like a +) and had her PINNED to the bed!! She had been trying to get up to go on a walk around the area!!  The Col has taken Gunny’s training up another level to a Canine Good Citizen award from the AKC, on her own training. What a team. I’ll post any more adventures from the Col and Gunny if she let’s me.

                                                            Chuck has had ”Migraine” headaches since a TBI from duty in the Army, he has undergone “Botox” shots which has been found to help other people with their headaches, he stated last night, that the first time or shots, did nothing, that was back 3 months ago, and nothing happened or,  NO RELIEF at all. Now, he had another “dose, or round of shots” 3 days before they arrived at the kennel, but nothing happened, until the 8th night of having Marley, when he said “Mike, I have no headache!” Well I said OK?? why do you say that? and he told me the story you have just read, but added that he now is not quite pain free, but went from a level 8 down to a 2! We want to watch this for a while, as we can NOT say for sure that the dog did it, or maybe it took 2 doses of the “Botox” or maybe the combination of the two? Chuck also was woke the first night in the kennel by Marley, and it was a “night terror” that Marley licked away! After that 1st night Marley proved,, she was not done with Chuck yet, every night so far she has intervened and told Chuck he had stopped breathing, he has  sleep apnea!   We will keep all informed of all events with Chuck and Marley.

                                                            A red Doberman selected Joel, Joel was instructed to do our “bonding shower” with his dog,  keeping this in your mind, Spartacus started his training, day 1 was OK,  then day 2, Joel was trying to get his dog to jump up into the car, NOT, he would not get into the car, my truck, Pam’s PT Cruiser, NOTHING, well I asked Joel how the shower went and he said “fine”,  great, ok, keep working, or, lifting the dog into my truck.  After day 2,3 and 4, I was upset that even I, could not get him to jump into the car or anything, I told Joel I have never had a problem like this, and IF,,  IF all was happening at night as I instructed, I am at a loss. Day 5, I came outside about 0800 and Joel was so excited I thought he was about to wet his pants, Joel had opened the back hatch of the PT Cruiser, opened the side door of the Excursion and his own jeep, and smiling as he showed me how his dog would eagerly jump into each and EVERY one or the cars and trucks!! Then, Joel told me that he had NOT given the dog the shower as I told him to, until the last night!  Well I told Joel that I was happy that we found the problem, sad that he wasted 3 days of training, but the main thing was DO AS THE TRAINER TELLS YOU!  You can see the team on Face Book under K9s for veterans, he and Spartacus in England. Good luck Joel he is a GREAT dog.
